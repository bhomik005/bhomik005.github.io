Welcome! I’m Bhomik and I love to design and build softwares. I created Derivatives & Opcodes to document my work and learning at the intersection of quantitative finance, physics, mathematics, and computer science. I’m especially interested in data structures, algorithms, low‑level programming, and system design.

This site compiles my projects and ongoing learnings.

- Explore my work: [`Projects`](/projects.html)
- Wanna checkout my C++ notes: [`C++ Notes`](/learnings/cpp-learning.html)
- View my resume: [`Resume`](/resume.html) or download the PDF [`here`](/Resume-2025.pdf)
- More updates coming soon. Stay tuned.
